  <h2>Introduction to Migrations</h2>
  </div>
  
<b>Migrations are the tools for creating and modifying database tables without having to learn SQL language.</b>[ref](https://realpython.com/lessons/what-django-migrations-and-problems-they-solve/)

All database systems supported by Django use SQL to handle CRUD operations in a relational db.

Django orm(object relational mapper) is a mapper that maps Python objects (models) to SQL tables. Using Django orm, we don't have to use SQL to create database tables.

Here, we have a model `PriceHistory` and it's fields mapped to db as a table and it's columns.

>But just defining a model class in a Python file does not make a database table magically appear out of nowhere. Creating the database tables to store your Django models is the job of a database migration. Additionally, whenever you make a change to your models, like adding a field, the database has to be changed too. Migrations handle that as well. [ref](https://realpython.com/django-migrations-a-primer/#the-problems-that-migrations-solve)

Here are a few ways Django migrations make your life easier.

<h3>Making database changes without SQL</h3>

In traditional SQL, if you want to make changes on your db tables, you'd have to write more SQL codes. (This is what I've read on the internet, not that I know SQL :)) However, with migrations, you can easily change your db models with plain Python coding. We only have to run `python manage.py makemigrations` to make database changes effective.

  <h2>Creating our model</h2>
  </div>
  
 Let's have `Person` model(table).
 
 ```py
 class Person(models.Model):
    class GenderChoices(models.TextChoices):
        male = 'M'
        female = 'F'

    name = models.CharField(max_length=50)
    age = models.PositiveIntegerField()
    gender = models.CharField(max_length=1, choices=GenderChoices.choices)
    
    class Meta:
        unique_together = ('name', 'age') 
 ```
 
 After we make our migrations by `python manage.py makemigrations`, we will have a python file `0001_initial.py` like this.
 
 ```py
 # Generated by Django 3.2.6 on 2022-03-03 18:34

from django.db import migrations, models


class Migration(migrations.Migration):

    initial = True

    dependencies = [
    ]

    operations = [
        migrations.CreateModel(
            name='Person',
            fields=[
                ('id', models.BigAutoField(auto_created=True, primary_key=True, serialize=False, verbose_name='ID')),
                ('name', models.CharField(max_length=50)),
                ('age', models.PositiveIntegerField()),
                ('gender', models.CharField(choices=[('M', 'Male'), ('F', 'Female')], max_length=1)),
            ],
        ),
    ]
```

The more changes (and migrations after) we make, the more `*?_initial.py` files we would have. For the second migration we make, we'll have 0002_foo_bar.py...

For example, we added `unique_together` to `name` and `age` fields and makemigrations again. We will have the following .py file.

<b>Here, important thing to notice is that every subsequent migration creates a new python file and they stack. (By stack, we mean that each subsequent file inherit from the previous migration's .py file)</b>
